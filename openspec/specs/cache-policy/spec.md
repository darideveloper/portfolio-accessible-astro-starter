Then the response headers MUST include `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`.

### Requirement: Public Asset Caching
**Requirement:** Public static assets (fonts, images) MUST be served with appropriate cache headers.
#### Scenario:
Given a user visits the site,
When the browser requests a font file (e.g., .woff2) or an image from `public/`,
Then the response headers SHOULD include a `Cache-Control` max-age of at least 1 week (604800 seconds), preferably 1 year.
