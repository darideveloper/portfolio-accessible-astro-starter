# Proposal: Standardize Project Tags for SEO

## Goal
Improve SEO and consistency by standardizing the `tags` used across all project files in `src/content/projects`.

## Requirements
- All project files must use tags from the approved SEO taxonomy.
- Non-standard, localized, or redundant tags must be replaced or removed.
- Each project should have at least 3-5 high-impact tags.

## Proposed Taxonomy
Refer to `design.md` for the full taxonomy list.
